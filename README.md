My name is Abasifreke Nkanang, A goal oriented, problem-solving data lover, who is capable of utilising a wide range of analytical tools to interpret data, to gain data-driven insights, so as to drive strategic business decisions.

I am a university student majoring in computer engineering, and pursuing a full-time career in data analytics. My goal is to ensure that I tell the right story using data. It is always a thing of joy, when I am able to use data to solve real world problems. Sometimes, I see myself as a "Data Interpreter” because I am often driven by my inept curiosity to really interpret the story my data is trying to tell.

I am looking to collaborate on any data science/analytics project.
You can ask me about anything on data analytics, data science, data visualization, or Tableau.
Contact me at abasifrekenkanang@gmail.com

Fun fact: I am a Python, SQl warrior 😁
